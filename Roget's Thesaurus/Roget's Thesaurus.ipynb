    "# Roget's Thesaurus in the 21st Century\n",
    "\n",
    "The first known thesaurus was written in the 1st century CE by [Philo of Byblos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philo_of_Byblos); it was called *Περὶ τῶν διαφόρως σημαινομένων*, loosly translated in English as *On Synonyms*. Fast forward about two millenia and we arrive to the most well known thesaurus, compiled by [Peter Mark Roget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Mark_Roget), a British physician, natural theologian, and lexicographer. [Roget's Thesaurus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roget%27s_Thesaurus) was released on 29 April 1852, containing 15,000 words. Subsequent editions were larger, with the latest totalling 443,000 words. In Greek the most well known thesaurus, *Αντιλεξικόν ή Ονομαστικόν της Νεοελληνικής Γλώσσης* was released in 1949 by [Θεολόγος Βοσταντζόγλου](https://el.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%98%CE%B5%CE%BF%CE%BB%CF%8C%CE%B3%CE%BF%CF%82_%CE%92%CE%BF%CF%83%CF%84%CE%B1%CE%BD%CF%84%CE%B6%CF%8C%CE%B3%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%85); the latest updated edition was released in 2008 and remains an indispensable source for writing in Greek.\n",
    "\n",
    "Roget organised the entries of the thesaurus in a hierarchy of categories. Your task in this assignment is to investigate how these categories fare with the meaning of English words as captured by Machine Learning techniques, namely, their embeddings.\n",
